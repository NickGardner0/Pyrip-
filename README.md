# Pyrip-
Pyrip is an API service built in python that takes website url's and scrapes/crawls the information you want and converts it into structured XML or JSON. 
The backend is currently self-host only but I plan on building a hosted version with an easy-to-use GUI so non-technical people can easily extract, structure, and store the web data they need.
