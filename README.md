# Pyrip-
Pyrip is an API service built in python that takes website url's and scrapes/crawls the information you want and converts it into structured XML or JSON. 
The backend is currently self-host only but I plan on building a hosted version with an easy-to-use GUI so non-technical people can easily extract, structure, and store the web data they need.

Self-hosting Pyrip is especially advantageous for organizations with strict security policies requiring data to stay within controlled environments. 

Here are some important reasons to consider self-hosting:

Increased Security and Compliance: Self-hosting allows you to ensure that all data handling and processing aligns with both internal and external regulatory standards, maintaining sensitive data within your secure infrastructure. Pyrip meets SOC2 Type2 certification standards, reflecting a commitment to high industry standards for data security management.

Customizable Services: Self-hosting enables you to customize services, like the Playwright service, to address specific needs or support particular use cases that may not be feasible with most standard cloud options.

Learning and Community Contribution: By setting up and managing your own instance, you develop a deeper understanding of how Pyrip operates, which can also facilitate more impactful contributions to the project.
